<p>Well, here I am trying out Octopress.  I  guess it's time for me to finally
join the 21st century and learn
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">MarkDown</a>.  I'm sure my
webs will be clearer if I do.</p>

<p>I'm listening to the Aquaria soundtrack.  I've only recently discovered video
game soundtracks.  I still feel pretty nerdy for liking them, but as my buddy
@brettcsmith keeps pointing out to me, they're sort of the perfect thing when
you want something to fill your head but not distract you.  It's what they're
designed for.</p>

<p>I seem to be having a problem with this thing generating a .markdown/index.html
version of my posts, which is pretty clearly wrong, in a moral sense.</p>
